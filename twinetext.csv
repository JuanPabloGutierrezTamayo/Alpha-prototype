the alarm clock rings.
it is 5:30AM
I have to get up early to attend classes at a university in my city.
But first of all, I have an important decision to make.
My university is not too far away, so I can walk there, but I'm a bit pressed for time, so I'll have to hurry.
Oh no, I overslept, it's been an hour! I'll be late!
While I am on my way, some parents or children greet me, I know many people in my neighborhood as I often help them treat their children and advise them on any problems they may have.
Up ahead I meet a young man of about 15 years old whom I tried to help a few months ago, he looked disorganized and a bit nervous.
The reason I tried to help them was because he had serious learning difficulties and was being bullied at school, it didn't help that he seemed to be malnourished, everything seemed to indicate that he had a developmental disorder.
I tried to explain to his parents and teachers at school the situation, to be patient and understanding with him, I advised his parents to take him to a professional.
I recently found out that nothing had worked out, even some teachers did not tolerate him and started to make fun of him, which led to more bullying from other classmates, so he decided not to go back to school.
The parents never called me again, I feel I made a big mistake, I still regret it.
"Behind my back I hear a person say: ""It's all your fault"", then I was pushed into the street."
I felt a loud bang.
suddenly everything went dark.
I hear a voice calling me...
The light becomes more and more intense, it seems that I have been walking towards this light for hours.
suddenly the light becomes blinding and forces me to close my eyes.
When I feel that the light is no longer so intense, I open my eyes little by little.
I see an unknown ceiling, I am on a bed.
I hear a woman's voice calling my name.
The voice calling me was my mother, telling me that I had to go to school.
I look in the mirror and see a young man around 14 or 15 years old.
It was... me.
* the light fades little by little *.
*It looks like my time has come*.
From what little I remember, it seems that I was hit by a car, but it seems to have happened too long ago, I have very blurry memories of what happened.
I head to school, thinking about why I'm still alive, maybe a second chance.
"On my way to my ""former"" school I hear someone calling me."
-Hey, $name!
He was my best friend at the time, Jhonn.
-Jhonn: Have you seen the news? 2 classmates from our school have mysteriously disappeared.
I remember that, at this time there was a wave of disappearances, they never found the bodies, nor the kidnapper.
-$name: we have to be careful, maybe we will be next!
I was waiting for the pedestrian light and the guy comes up to me without saying a word, so I ask him how it's going, and apologize for not being able to help him more.
The boy still doesn't say a word....
Finally the boy says goodbye to me, so I say goodbye to him too.
On the way to school, we continued to talk about different things.
Once we arrived at the school, I noticed a black car, but I didn't pay much attention to it.
We got to the living room and I sat in the back, so I could see the others.
The teacher came in and told us about the news, telling us to be careful when we went out and if we saw anyone suspicious to inform the police.
All the victims had something in common, they seemed to have a mental or behavioral disorder.
In the room there were 4 classmates with some kind of disorder, but they had not yet been diagnosed, but the kidnapper is someone quite perceptive, and he knows perfectly well who are the most vulnerable.
Fortunately, I read a guide on mental and behavioral disorders.
Talking to jhon, Amber, Pedro, Christina
I went to talk to John, and we talked for a while.
I noticed that he was very active, he always had something to tell, he didn't seem like a bad person.
I was watching him and noticed that he was too easily distracted and unable to sit still, his grades were not the best either.
Amber has always been a troublemaker, always arguing with the adults, throwing constant tantrums and being quite explosive when she gets angry.
in spite of this, he does not seem to be a bad person.
I tried to talk to her, but she presented a defiant attitude, making it difficult to approach.
Pedro was what many consider a bully, he tended to challenge others, was somewhat irritable, and easily angered.
The few friends I had were not the best, they used to steal tools from other classmates.
He and amber were good friends, after all they were quite alike.
Pedro didn't usually attend class much, but today he came in and seemed to be a bit discouraged, so I approached him and we talked for a while.
Chris, she was my friend at the time, she was beautiful, she looked like she was carved by the angels themselves.
Today she seemed a little down, so I went to talk to her, I appreciated her a lot and tried to support her whenever she had problems, her life has been difficult, her parents are conflictive and constantly argue with each other, her mother often scolds her a lot and forbids her to go out with her friends constantly.
I have been trying to be supportive of her, as she is quite fearful and easily irritated.
after insisting, we talked during the whole class, he was telling me how he saved some people from an avalanche, or that his father had gone to the moon, etc... I could tell he was lying.
but there was something that made me very uneasy.
He described with such naturalness videos where cats were mistreated and people were tortured, it didn't seem to affect him in the least.
He didn't seem like a normal person, from what I remember, this kind of attitude had been going on for a while, he had this kind of attitude everywhere, not just at school.
Amber's refusal, I decided to go to Jhonn first, he seems to be friendlier.
The alarm went off for recess, so I said goodbye to her and headed to the school store.
In the middle of the drive I remembered that black car parked in front of our school, I immediately felt that Amber could be in danger and I headed to the teacher's lounge to talk to our teacher.
I told our teacher Mr. Braum about the suspicious black car, Amber could be in danger since she always goes against the teachers' instructions.
Since I was a good student, the teacher trusted me.
As the days go by, Amber's behavior worsens, the adults don't seem to care, they think it's just a passing thing.
One day Amber decided to run away from school, that was the last time we saw her.
Two weeks later she was found dead.
When you see the news, you fall into a deep depression for not having done anything, probably because you were a victim of the kidnapper.
you stop eating, you no longer attend school, you become more and more isolated from society until you decide to leave this world.
The police arrived shortly but the black car was gone so nothing could be done about it.
As the days went by, Amber continued to go to school and her parents went to pick her up at the end of classes, and although she continued to be somewhat confrontational, she argued less with the teachers.
Apparently the parents, after Professor Braum alerted them about their daughter, had decided to take Amber to a psychologist.
According to his activity, it is very likely that he suffers from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
Because of this problem, he is rejected by some people in the school, including teachers.
We chatted until recess and everything seemed to be going normal.
We were talking until recess, I decided to wait and see what happened.
Classes ended and everyone headed home, although I was worried about that black car, I was confident that nothing would happen to John on the way home.
The next day Jhonn didn't go to school, it seemed strange to me, but I thought he was sick.
The teacher arrives and says she has some bad news, John had been run over and killed after jaywalking.
Perhaps if I had accompanied him yesterday none of this would have happened.
I talked to Professor Braum, told him about the symptoms he was having and that he needed to be treated as soon as possible so that his school life would be as normal as possible.
I remembered that black car I saw in the driveway, John would be a possible victim because he was so distracted, so I mentioned this to the professor.
Mr. braum contacted the parents and informed them of what had happened.
the police arrived and the black car was gone.
I decided to accompany John home.
On the way, I noticed that John was more discouraged than usual, I asked him what was wrong, and he told me that he didn't like being in the house, but he didn't say anything else.
I guess his parents must be strict, or not patient enough to deal with jhonn.
The problem with many adults today is that they normalize this type of attitude and think that with time it will go away. I hope that by talking to the teacher they will decide to go to a psychologist and learn how to treat John.
As the days went by, Johnn and I became closer, he tells me that his parents have been going with him to the psychologist and he was diagnosed with ADHD.
Apparently he is realizing that his antenna deficit is giving him a lot of trouble.
I won't go into details, but he told me that he has been living with his father for the last year, his parents were divorced and Pedro lived with his mother, but she died in a car accident and he had to go to live with his father.
His father was very strict, besides being addicted to alcohol, so there were constant fights.
His behavioral problems were caused by this situation.
I told him that he had to stop getting into trouble and proposed to talk to Professor Braum, to which he agreed.
A situation like this is very difficult to handle, so it was out of my hands, so this was all I could do.
At the end of class, we went to Mr. Braum and explained the whole situation to him.
Days went by and Pedro stopped attending more frequently, until one day, he didn't come back anymore.
No one seemed to care much, some were even relieved that he was no longer there, however, I decided to go to Pedro's house on my own and ask what had happened to him.
I knocked several times on their door but no one answered, I went the next 3 days after school waiting for a response, which never came.
A week later, news came out that Pedro and his father had disappeared, and Pedro's father was suspected of murdering his son.
I couldn't believe it, Pedro's disappearance was not caused by the kidnapper, but by his own father.
It was decided to call the Child and Adolescent Police to assess the situation.
At that moment I remembered the mysterious kidnappings and that black car, so I told Mr. Braum and he called the police, but when they arrived, the car was empty and nothing more could be done.
the next day the police arrived at pedro's apartment, they told his father that he could lose custody of his son and impose a fine if the situation did not end, the father reluctantly agreed.
The days went by and Pedro told me that he wanted to dedicate himself to studying so as not to be a bad father like his own.
The recess alarm sounded, and we separated until the day was over.
I told her if she wanted to go to my house to hang out and she agreed, on the way I noticed that she was quite thin, I am worried about the situation she is going through.
We stayed up late into the night playing board games, chatting, among other things, his mood had improved a bit.
I told her that it looked bad, that we should seek professional help, she was a little hesitant, but in the end she agreed.
I decided not to pay much attention to it, but I did talk to her from time to time.
Days go by, she stops going to school, I call her but she doesn't answer her cell phone, I call her parents, but they tell me that she doesn't want to leave her room, I tell them that they have to help her, if she continues like this something irremediable could happen.
The next day I received the news that she had been found hanged in her room.
She slept over at my house since it was too late to go out.
The next day Chris was gone, he had left early for home.
Arriving at school I met her, she seemed to be sleepy, she told me that she could not sleep almost, but that it was something normal, I asked her if it was okay to tell Professor Braum, to which she said yes.
She tells me that on the way to school she noticed a black car following her, but she had lost it on the way.
I went to Professor Braum and told him what happened, someone could be in danger, even my friend.
Professor Braum told me that he was going to notify the police, and to go to class because I was going to be late.
At recess, Chris and I went to the teacher for advice on what to do.
In fact, he reassured us to seek professional help and offered to mediate with the family, Chris was grateful.
As the days went by, the parents took the decision to divorce, it seemed to be the best decision for Chris' health, Chris looked a little happier, although she was quite irritated from time to time.
The important thing at the moment is to keep supporting her, and prevent her from doing something crazy.
A few days later, Professor Braum told me that at the end of the day he would come to the teachers' lounge, which seemed strange to me.
Once the day was over, I went to the teachers' lounge, but there was no one there, I waited 2 minutes until he arrived.
The reason Mr. Braum called me was to congratulate me for caring about others and invited me to lunch, to which I agreed. We went to a restaurant in his car north of the city.
We had a long conversation about my future and what I wanted to do, among other things.
After we finished eating, we got into the car and Mr. Braum offered to drive me home.
5 minutes later I realize that Professor Braum was going in the opposite direction to my house.
-$name: Mr. Braum that way is not my home.
#¿NOMBRE?
-$name: realize what?
-Braum: don't be a fool and stay that way.
At that moment I felt a chill, I had a bad feeling.
-$name: don't tell me that...
-Braum: How did you know who the next ones were? did you come from the future? I couldn't capture them thanks to you, so you will be their replacement.
I noticed that that suspicious looking black car looked a lot like Mr. Braum's car, who would say he was the killer, it took me by surprise.
Because of the difference in strength, I couldn't stop him from strapping me into the passenger seat, although I resisted with all my might.
It was already very late, so there were no people on the street.
Braum drove to a river on the edge of the city.
-Braum: It was a pity, you were a good student, but this was the end you chose to get in my way.
-$name: Damn you Braum, I trusted you!
-Braum: You shouldn't trust just anyone, although you won't have to worry about that anymore.
Braum accelerates towards the river, plans to sink the car, but at the last moment he jumps out of the car, leaving me tied up to drown.
-$name: I will kill you!
Those were my last words.
It's been 10 years now, I was in a coma all this time, however, for me it was like a blink of an eye, my friend Christina and my mother were taking care of me all this time.
Chris had recently given birth to a baby, I was relieved that she decided to move on with her life, but she still worried about me.
Someone knocked on the door, it was the doctor who came to check that everything was in order.
the doctor wheeled me to the hospital elevator.
-Doctor: I didn't think you survived, yet it took you time to wake up.
-$name: Professor Braum...
At this point nothing surprised me.
Braum led me to a hanging bridge across a river, which was owned by the hospital.
-Braum: I've been waiting all this time for you to wake up, so now I can give you an end worthy of the scum you are!
Braum took me to the middle of the bridge with the intention of throwing me off the bridge.
I decided to resist, Braum didn't count on me being able to stand up, I got up from the chair and in the middle of the hustle and bustle I managed to throw him into the void.
From that height it is impossible for him to have survived.
I felt no remorse, this person will not be able to hurt anyone else, I lost 10 years of my life but I avoided this horrible massacre.
The police arrived, apparently Christina saw in the distance how Braum was leading me to the bridge, she always had suspicions that he was responsible for all this.
No charges were made against me, everything concluded that it had been self-defense.
I played along, I didn't have much strength to resist, my plan was to take Braum with me, so I couldn't hurt anyone else.
-Braum: see you never, $name.
Just as I was about to launch myself, I grabbed his arm and pulled him towards me, we both slipped off the bridge, but I was able to grab hold of the railing.
However, Braum grabs my foot in, both of us dangling.
I lose strength, I am not able to resist the weight, my hand slips.
-Braum: see you in hell, you little runt!
I hear the police sirens, apparently someone had called the police, however, Braum and I fall into the void, without hope.
